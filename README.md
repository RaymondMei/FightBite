# FightBite
Hack the 6ix 2022

FightBite is a modular and interactive phone application that allows users to quickly and effectively take a picture of a bug bite or take an existing picture and get instant feedback on the type of bug bite, whether it be a mosquito, tick, or even bed-bug bite. In addition to detecting the bug type, FightBite also pulls up the relevant medical information for bite treatment.
